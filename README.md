# Speech-Assistant-Project

Python app that uses speech recognition and text-to-speech.
Working on implementing offline text-to-speech with pyttsx3

### Dependencies

```
pip install speechrecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install pyaudio
pip install playsound
pip install PyObjC
```

### Current Voice Commands

Working on adding more, but this is what I have so far

- What is your name?
- What time is it
- Search
- Find Location
- Exit

### What I learned

- Using Google's text-to-speech API
- Turning strings into audio and playing through the microphone
- Installing, importing, and using third party python packages
